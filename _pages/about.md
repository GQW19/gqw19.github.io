I am a CS Ph.D. Student at Georgia Institute of Technology specializing in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. My research is at the intersection of **Cybersecurity**, **Network Measurement**, and **Machine Learning**. Recently, my work has focused on approaches and techniques for IPv6 Internet-wide scanning, and deploying IPv6 scanning for Internet-wide Security experiments (like ZMap did for IPv4).  



I am advised by Prof. [Paul Pearce](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~pearce/) at Georgia Tech in the [School of Cybersecurity and Privacy](https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/). Prior to pursuing my Ph.D. I obtained an MS in Machine Learning.
